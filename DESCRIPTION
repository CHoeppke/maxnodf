Description: This package contains functions to generate graphs that maximise
    the NODF metric for a given number of rows, columns and links. As nestedness in
    ecological networks depends on the size of the networks we require normalisation
    to make them comparable [1]. We offer three highly optimised algorithms to find
    the optimising graphs so that users can choose an appropriate trade off between
    computation time and NODF value for the task at hand. [1] Chuliang Song, Rudolf
    P. Rohr, and Serguei Saavedra. Why are some plantpollinator networks more nested
    than others? Journal of Animal Ecology, 86(6):1417â€“1424.
